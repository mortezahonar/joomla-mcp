# Changelog

All notable changes to the published packages are documented here. Releases
follow Semantic Versioning.

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- Normalize combined article text to Joomla's native `introtext` and `fulltext`
  before planning API or companion creates and updates, fixing silently unchanged
  article bodies on Joomla 6 PATCH requests ([#31](https://github.com/joomengine/joomla-mcp/issues/31)).
- Preserve Joomla Read More splitting, clear old full text on complete body
  replacement, and reject ambiguous combined/native text inputs. Native partial
  text updates and title-only updates retain omitted content.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Packaged `joomla-mcp-live-test` interactive and unattended runner with
  selectable read, CRUD, and full profiles across Joomla API/companion paths
  and stdio/Streamable HTTP MCP transports.
- Deterministic, dependency-aware dummy data for every one of the 36 CRUD
  families, including create, read-back, update, deletion-candidate,
  verification, retention, and cleanup behavior.
- Catalogue coverage gates for every Joomla API and companion action, with the
  five source-only routes reported explicitly instead of silently skipped.
- Redacted Markdown, JSON, JUnit, and per-action evidence with failure codes,
  source references, expected/actual results, dependency/root-cause links,
  exact reproduction commands, fixture identities, and transport diagnostics.
- Complete live-validation documentation for interactive demos, unattended
  sites, CI, safety, cleanup, and failure investigation.

### Changed

- The disposable JoomEngine Joomla 6.1 job now creates an ephemeral API actor
  token, configures the companion actor, and runs the full packaged live suite
  through all four MCP/Joomla path combinations before teardown.
- Template-style CRUD accepts Joomla's required `template` field consistently
  in the API and companion allowlists.
- Insecure Joomla API origins remain rejected except for an explicit
  loopback-only fixture opt-in.

### Compatibility

- Existing library, CLI, HTTP, Docker, systemd, API, companion, catalogue,
  permission, plan/apply, deployment, and release behavior is retained.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added

- Public `@joomengine/joomla-mcp` ESM library package with TypeScript
  declarations and documented root, configuration, catalogue, adapter, HTTP,
  and security exports.
- Transport-neutral `createJoomlaMcp` application factory with shared runtime
  semantics for stdio, embedded transports, and authenticated HTTP sessions.
- Host injection contracts for audit, Joomla API, and Joomla companion CLI
  adapters.
- Programmatic configuration resolution with asynchronous host-owned secret
  lookup.
- Principal selection for embedded transports without MCP `AuthInfo`.
- Clean-tarball JavaScript import and strict TypeScript consumer tests.
- Coordinated npm, Joomla companion, OCI image, deployment bundle, SBOM,
  checksum, and provenance release workflow.
- Complete library integration, executable host examples, compatibility
  policy, and release documentation.

### Changed

- The existing stdio and HTTP binaries now use the same public application
  factory exported to package consumers.
- Package, companion, fixture, documentation, and release versions are
  synchronized through one version command and release gate.

### Compatibility

- Existing command-line, container, systemd, Joomla API, Joomla companion,
  catalogue, permission, plan, apply, audit, and deployment capabilities are
  retained.
